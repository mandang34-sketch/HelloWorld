I'am Ryan Mosley. I am a data driven operator and communicator who sits at the intersection of store operations, analytics, and change management.

I work for Target in Store Operations, focused on Store Communications and platform work. Academically, I have a Master’s in Operations and Project Management from Southern New Hampshire University, which I completed debt free through Target’s education program. I am also building a foundation in data science through coursework at Bellevue University. Between those two paths, I have learned to think in structured frameworks, to tell a story with data, and to balance technical depth with business practicality.# HelloWorld
